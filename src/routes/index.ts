/**
 * MODERN ROUTING SYSTEM
 * 
 * Routes are now handled by decorator-based controllers that are
 * automatically registered through the module system.
 * 
 * Controllers use @Controller, @Get, @Post, etc. decorators and
 * are automatically attached through the modular architecture.
 * 
 * Individual route files are no longer needed.
